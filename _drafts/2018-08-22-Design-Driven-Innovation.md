title: Design-Driven Innovation - Applying Customer-Driven Methods to Create New Markets
author: Travis Lowdermilk

On of the most common questions we get during our Customer-Driven Engineering workshops is, "how can I remain customer-centered, if there is no market yet?"

People that ask this question will often refer to automotive pioneer Henry Ford's famous quote:

>"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

The root of this question is simple. How can a team be forward-thinking or radically innovative if they are required to validate their future vision will solve a problem for customers _today_?

That's the premise of [Design Driven Innovation: Changing the Rules of Competition by Radically Innovating What Things Mean](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Driven-Innovation-Competition-Innovating/dp/1422124827/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534978069&sr=8-3&keywords=design-driven+innovation, "Design Driven Innovation: Changing the Rules of Competition by Radically Innovating What Things Mean") by Roberto Veraganti.

### Every Product Has Meaning
Veraganti proposes that people do not buy products, they buy _meanings_. This is the major point of his thesis.

### The Challenge with User-Centered Design 
Veraganti challenges companies to invest in radical innovation of meaning. He doesn't believe that companies can achieve radical innovation by simply asking customers for feedback on existing products.

>If a company tests a breakthrough change in meaning by relying on a typical focus group, people will search for what they already know. And they will not find it in a product that is radically innovative, unless they encounter it in the right scenario.

However, it should be noted that Veraganti is not suggesting companies remove customers from the equation. Rather, the "customer" you're looking to collect feedback from is actually an _interpreter_.

### The Power of Interpreters
Apple's popular, long-time, manifesto perfectly describes the Interpreter:

>“Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… The ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

Steve Jobs brought the iPod to market and, not only saved Apple, but completely re-defined the meaning of music. He was able to interpret industry signals and envision the future of digital music.

There were other competitors in the space at the time. The Diamond Rio and Creative's Nomad player. These players certainly captured early adopters' attention and had the first mover's advantage.

However, Jobs understood that current solutions were just _technology substitutions_; they were offering the same meaning (e.g. listening to music on the go), but replacing the technology (e.g. instead of a CD walkman, an .mp3 player). 

Jobs had listened and observed the market and had interpreted a new meaning. Customers needed a complete experience when dealing with music. They needed an easy way to convert their existing music to digital format, they needed an inexpensive way to purchase new digital music, and some even needed a way to _produce_ digital music.

That's why the iPod shipped within an ecosystem of iTunes, the iTunes store, and Garage Band.

Current players had clunky software and awkward workflows. Additionally, there wasn't an easy way to purchase digital music and sync it directly to the player.

Jobs changed the meaning of a digital music player to be that of a digital music _library manager_. In fact, Apple's entire product strategy had a new meaning. The MacBook, iMac, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iPod became tools that helped you "manage your digital lifestyle." This was more than a technology substitution, the introduction of the iPod represented a technology _epiphany_.

### Leveraging a Network of Interpreters
Veraganti isn't proposing that companies must find a sole Interpreter to help them achieve radical innovation of meaning. In fact, it's quite the opposite.

He encourages companies to build a network of Interpreters. To seek out those that are investigating and giving meaning to the observations around them. The people will be involved in the "design discourse" and companies should look for ways to, not only participate in the discourse, but to _influence_ those networks as well.

With the iPod, Jobs enabled Veraganti's 3 phases of participating in the design discourse: interpreting: Listening, Interpreting, and Addressing.

#### Listening
Accessing knowledge about possible meanings and languages of new products.

#### Interpreting
Generating your own vision and proposals for new meanings and languages.

### Addressing
Diffusing your vision to other Interpreters.

With the iPod, Jobs was listening to developments in smaller hard drive technologies. He was interpreting a new meaning for these drives (using them for a music player, instead of a laptop computer). Finally, he communicated that vision with hard drive pioneers by detailing specifications that would be required to make a small hard drive work in a music player.

Apple was not only listening to the discourse of mobile hard drive development, they were _influencing it_.

### Using Customer-Driven Methods with Influencers
