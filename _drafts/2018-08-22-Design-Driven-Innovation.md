title: Design-Driven Innovation - Applying Customer-Driven Methods to Create New Markets
author: Travis Lowdermilk

On of the most common questions we get during our Customer-Driven Engineering workshops is, "how can I remain customer-centered, if there is no market yet?"

People that ask this question will often refer to automotive pioneer Henry Ford's famous quote:

>"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

The root of this question is simple. How can a team be forward-thinking or radically innovative if they are required to validate their future vision will solve a problem for customers _today_?

That's the premise of [Design Driven Innovation: Changing the Rules of Competition by Radically Innovating What Things Mean](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Driven-Innovation-Competition-Innovating/dp/1422124827/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534978069&sr=8-3&keywords=design-driven+innovation, "Design Driven Innovation: Changing the Rules of Competition by Radically Innovating What Things Mean") by Roberto Veraganti.

### Every Product Has Meaning
People do not buy products, they buy _meanings_.

### The Challenge with User-Centered Design 
Veraganti proposes that 

>If a company tests a breathrough change in meaning by relying on a typical focus group, people will search for what they already know. And they will not find it in a product that is radically innovative, unless they encounter it in the right scenario.

### Design is More than Providing Form
It should be noted that Veraganti uses design in the broadest of defninitions.

### Building a Network of Interpreters

Apple's popular, long-time, manifesto perfectly describes the Interpreter:

>“Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… The ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

Steve Jobs brought the iPod to market and, not only saved Apple, but completely re-defined the meaning of music.

Jobs was a classic example of an Interpreter. He followed Verganti's 3 stages of Design-Driven Innovation when creating the iPod.

There were other competitors in the space at the time. The Diamond Rio and Creative's Nomad player. These players certainly captured early adopters' attention and had the first mover's advantage.

However, Jobs understood that customers needed a complete experience when dealing with music. They needed an easy way to convert their existing music to digital format, they needed a way to purchase new digital music, and some even needed a way to _produce_ digital music.

That's why the iPod shipped within an ecosystem of iTunes, the iTunes store, and Garage Band.

Current players had clunky software and awkward workflows. Additionally, there wasn't an easy way to purchase digital music and sync it directly to the player.

Jobs changed the meaning of a digital music player to be that of a digital music _library manager_. In fact, Apple's entire product strategy had a new meaning. The MacBook, iMac, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iPod became a way to "manage your digital lifestyle"
