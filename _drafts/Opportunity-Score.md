title: What is (Ulwick's) Opportunity Score?
author: JP Carrascal
---

First of all, a word of caution. The Opportunity Score is a tool that allows (among other things) to estimate market opportunity, to prioritize efforts in product development and to conduct competitive analysis. It is part of a larger framework created by Anthony W. Ulwick and called "Opportunity-Driven Innovation", that aims at making "innovation predictable." This article focuses specifically on the Opportunity Score calculation. However, the Opportunity Score is not a silver bullet, and if you want to use properly, you should read a bit more on the Opportunity-Driven Innovation process to get the whole picture. I have included a few links in the "Further Reading" section at the end of the article if you want to know more.
