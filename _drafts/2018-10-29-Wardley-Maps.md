With frank honesty, Simon Wardley opens his book (a series of extensive blog posts - https://medium.com/wardleymaps) describing how he asked himself the same question, not as an interested bystander but as a "bumbling and confused CEO".

Throughout eighteen lengthy blog posts, Wardley describes how he answered this question by examining what he needed to do in order to continue to make his company succesful. During his examination he discovered that only by understanding the landscape of the business environment that he was operating in would he be able to make decisions about his business that he felt confident in. To understand that landscape, he needed a map.
