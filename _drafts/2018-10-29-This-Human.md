title: This Human. How to be the person designing for other people. By Melis Senova, PhD.
author: JP Carrascal

_This Human_ is a design book that is not about design but about the _designer_. The book shifts focus from business goals and design technique and puts the desiner---the human, the person---in the spotlight.
It discusses several aspects of the designer's role, reflecting upon the mindset, attitude and behaviors that lead to improving outcome and that make the designer's job easier and more pleasant.

Something I enjoyed about the book is that it embraces playfulness and imagination as necessary elements of design work. To counterbalance this, the book also deals with biases and blockers that potentially hinder the designer's job at different stages, and suggests methods for overcoming them. In that sense, it constantly plays with the [converge-diverge pattern](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/ElevenLessons_Design_Council%20(2).pdf, "A study of the design process") often used for illustrating design thinking processes.


The book is organized into 7 sections that are meant to go from the most abstract to the most pragmatic.
