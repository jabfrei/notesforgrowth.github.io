_This Human_ is a design book that is not about design but about the _designer_. The book shifts focus from business goals and design technique and puts the desiner---the human, the person---in the spotlight.
It discusses several aspects of the designer's role, reflecting upon the mindset, attitude and behaviors that lead to improving outcome and that make the designer's job easier and more pleasant.

Something I enjoyed about the book is that it embraces playfulness, imagination and other very human personality features that should be nurtured to design in a compelling and meaningful way.

From my personal point of view, the main learnings of those 7 sections fall well into a higher level structure structure, composed of Input, Processing, and Output, which I explain next.

## Insight
This is the chapter that more strongly focuses on how to overcome cognitive biases. The reasoning is that biases (including those derived from our own beliefs) obscure our vision and makes it difficult for a designer to distill insights from findings or results. Self-awareness and self-criticism are necessary to overcome biases and seeing beyond our preconceptions.
