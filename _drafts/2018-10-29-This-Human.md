title: This Human. How to be the person designing for other people. By Melis Senova, PhD.
author: JP Carrascal

_This Human_ is a design book that is not about design but about the _designer_. The book shifts focus from business goals and design technique and puts the desiner---the human, the person---in the spotlight.
It discusses several aspects of the designer's role, reflecting upon the mindset, attitude and behaviors that lead to improving outcome and that make the designer's job easier and more pleasant.

The book embraces playfulness, imagination, emotion and other human features that (according to the author) should be nurtured in order to create compelling and meaningful design. The book also addresses biases and blockers that potentially hinder the designer's job at different stages, and suggests methods for overcoming them.

## Keep your mind open

Biases (including those derived from our own beliefs) obscure our vision and makes it difficult for a designer to distill insights from findings or results. Self-awareness and self-criticism are necessary to overcome biases and seeing beyond our preconceptions.

(This is mainly discussed in the _Insights_ section but the idea permeates the whole book.)

## Empathy, compassion, and listening are key.

Design is done by humans for humans. Having a _connection_ with those we are designing for makes it possible to understand their context and needs. Designers should not only make sure they are paying attention to people's practical needs but also to their _emotions_ to create a strong connection. 

## Don't be afraid to explore

While biases limit our vision, imagination and emotion enhances it, as they allow to create multiple possible paths to solve a problem (the possible futures). We should let ourselves ride free as creative minds and beating hearts to explore the limitless world of ideas&mdash;the right one could be hiding anywhere. This is alike the Diverge phase in the [converge-diverge pattern](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/ElevenLessons_Design_Council%20(2).pdf, "A study of the design process") often used for illustrating the design thinking process.
(Discussed in the _Envision_ and _Emotion_ sections.)
