title: This Human. How to be the person designing for other people. By Melis Senova, PhD.
author: JP Carrascal

_This Human_ is a design book that is not about design but about the _designer_. The book shifts focus from business goals and design technique and puts the desiner---the human, the person---in the spotlight.
It discusses several aspects of the designer's role, reflecting upon the mindset, attitude and behaviors that lead to improving outcome and that make the designer's job easier and more pleasant.

Something I enjoyed about the book is that it embraces playfulness, imagination and other human personality features that (according to the author), should be nurtured in order to create compelling and meaningful design. The book also deals with biases and blockers that potentially hinder the designer's job at different stages, and suggests methods for overcoming them. In that sense, the book plays with the [converge-diverge pattern](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/ElevenLessons_Design_Council%20(2).pdf, "A study of the design process") often used for illustrating design thinking processes.



The book is organized into 7 sections that, according to the Dr. Senova ("how to use this book" section, page xi), go from the most abstract to the most pragmatic. I see this as the designer's journey, in which the main learnings of those sections align well to the flow of information in a designer's head, from Input, going through Processing, and concluding in the Output. I will explain this next.

# Inputs




## Insight
This is the chapter that more strongly focuses on how to overcome cognitive biases. The reasoning is that biases (including those derived from our own beliefs) obscure our vision and makes it difficult for a designer to distill insights from findings or results. Self-awareness and self-criticism are necessary to overcome biases and seeing beyond our preconceptions.
